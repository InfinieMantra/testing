***Please note: Each book is carefully hand-bound. They are strong and sturdy but due to the nature of the bounding technique, the journals are NOT meant to be opened like a butterfly.

***When opening, it needs to fold from the front cover on the line and then fold each following page as you go. I DO NOT recommend folding the journal flat all the way to the spine of the journal. Thank you***

***Please note: Each book is carefully hand-bound. They are strong and sturdy but due to the nature of the bounding technique, the journals are NOT meant to be opened like a butterfly.

Under the Moon Digital Planner

From my original artworks the Under the Moon Digital Planner is ideal for planning your year, month, weeks and daily plans as well as goal setting.


Details

**This is an undated planner, and can be used year after year!
**All pages are hyperlinked
**The icon on the bottom right corner: takes you to the next page 
**The icon on the top left will redirect you to the initial contents page 
**All monthly tabs will direct you to the corresponding monthly pages
**Each month offers a goal setting page, weekly layouts, as well as a page for a daily journal entry
**Pairs with online note taking app “Goodnotes” for user convenience
**Features an original art cover design (This is a separate file and you can use for any journal cover you like!)
* Please note that photos directly show what is included.
 
How to Download and Install Your Journal:

**Save the planner to your choice of file service (Dropbox, iCloud, Google Drive, etc…)
**Launch the “Goodnotes” app on your device
**Click the “+” icon in the top left side of the screen, and choose “import”
**Select your chosen file service, then select your planner
**Remember that the cover and the planner itself are two separate files. Import the cover first, then the planner to create the full planner.

Are you looking to bring life into your room? Well come on and make our white lotus art print a part of your home. We know that you love nature, and this beautiful flower is in full bloom. So go ahead and bring this lovely painting home, so you can bring the outdoors, indoors.

Throughout many cultures over time, the lotus has been a powerful image and a spiritual symbol. In Hindu, Buddhist and Egyptian religions, the lotus is considered a sacred flower.

Among its many meanings and significance, the lotus is a symbol of ""spontaneous"" generation, and so it also represents divine birth, spiritual development and creation itself.

Because the lotus rises from unclean water to blossom as a pure, uncontaminated flower, it is a symbol of purity and resurrection.

In the same way the lotus flower goes through much in its growth before emerging from dirty water to become a beautiful flower, the individual consciousness does the same on its path to enlightenment as the so-called impurities of unenlightened thinking gradually fades.

"Limited Edition, Limited Edition, Stargazer Bullet Journal,  Bullet Journals, Bullet Journals, Notebook,  Notebook, Gifts, Gift Idea","Stargazer Journal

This bullet journal notebook is printed from one of my original artworks . It is ideal for planning your year, month and week according to the bullet journal method, or simply writing down thoughts & ideas, observations or travel plans. It's also great to use it to clear your mind before meditating, or to end your meditation session on an inspiring note or journal about your yoga practice, or use as a sketchbook... the possibilities are endless.

Hand-bound, allover printed notebooks great for journaling, drawing, note keeping and more!  Rich, creamy white 70 lb acid free paper, scuff resistant velvet ultra matte laminate cover, to full HD resolution colour print cover, care is put into this notebook to turn blank paper into your inspiring go-to notebook.

Hand-bound, allover printed notebooks great for journaling, drawing, note keeping and more!  Rich, creamy white 70 lb acid free paper, scuff resistant velvet ultra matte laminate cover, to full HD resolution colour print cover, care is put into this notebook to turn blank paper into your inspiring go-to notebook.
